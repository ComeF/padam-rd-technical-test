# R&D Tech Lead Test

Goal of this exercise is to assess your python coding skills.

To perform this test, please fork the repository and open a pull request when you're done. (Please tell us by email when you're ready for review! :smiley:).

## Objective
Given an undirected graph, you need to compute a path which travels each edge at least one time (pseudo-eulerian path), total distance traveled (sum of edges' weight) being the smallest possible.

## Input
A few instances are available for downloading [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGOxSN0obzDSZoiZZ351Fn8WeRMK-jEI?usp=sharing).
### Format
- First line of file contains 2 numbers: first is total number of vertices, second is total number of edges in the graph.
- Then vertices are listed: the 2 numbers given are the vertex coordinates in a 2-D plan. Vertex id is 0 for the first given vertex, then, 1, 2... and so on.
- Then are listed the edges, with 3 numbers being: id of 1st vertex, id of 2d vertex, weight associated with their edge.

## Assessment criteria
- You must provide an answer for all [given instances](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGOxSN0obzDSZoiZZ351Fn8WeRMK-jEI?usp=sharing). Answer must be given in reasonable time (on a standard performance computer).
- Special attention will be given to code quality, architecture, readability, genericity.
- Current code is provided only to get started easily. You may want to edit it, or not using it. Feel free to arrange the project as you wish.

## Project setup
- This project uses `python3`.
- Install requirements with running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- You can then run `python main.py -h` to see usage.

## Advices
- Do not spend more than 3 hours on this test.
- Do not hesitate to submit a partial rendering, flagging with `#TODO` items you hadn't time to complete.


Good luck!
